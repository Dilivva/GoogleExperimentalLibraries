/**
 * Represents the current state of a printer connection process.

 *
 * @property deviceName A human-readable name representing the current device.
 * @property discoveredPrinter Indicates whether a printer has been discovered during the search process.
 * @property canPrint Indicates if the discovered printer is considered printable (might depend on additional factors like compatibility or supported features).
 * @property isConnected Indicates if a successful connection has been established with the printer.
 * @property isBluetoothReady Specific to Bluetooth connections, indicates if the Bluetooth functionality is ready for use (e.g., Bluetooth enabled on the device).
 * @property bluetoothConnectionError An optional `ConnectionError` object containing details about any errors encountered during Bluetooth connection attempts.
 * @property isPrinting Indicates if a print job is currently being sent to the printer.
 * @property isScanning Indicates if the system is actively searching for printers (relevant for discovery phase).
